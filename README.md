# Programming Engineering Applications class

The Polish name of this class was:

#### Programowanie Aplikacji In≈ºynierskich

This is an exported `wkoszekpai` repo which I wrote during my CS studies
~7 years ago. It was writing for "Programming Engineering Applications"
class.

I lost the "regression" directory. And I don't have input files. So this
code is likely to be used only by Technical University of Czestochowa
students for the very same class.

This project is when my interest in compilers and parsers was starting, so I
think the only decent part of this project is input reading. As far as I
remember, the selling point was that it handled input well and produced
understandable error warnings.
